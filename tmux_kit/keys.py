Terminal input helpers for POST /api/sessions/{name}/input.

This module is the argv-construction layer for typing into tmux sessions
over the API. It is deliberately tiny and pure (no I/O) so the security
properties are auditable at a glance and unit-testable without tmux.

Security model (see the endpoint in main.py for the enforcement order):

- Text is sent with ``tmux send-keys -l`` (literal mode) via
  ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` (argv, NEVER a shell). Literal mode
  means arbitrary text -- including shell metacharacters -- is typed into
  the pane as characters, never interpreted by tmux or by any shell that
  muxplex spawns. Whatever the *pane* does with typed characters (e.g. a
  shell executing a line when Enter arrives) is the pane's own behavior,
  identical to a human typing -- that is the endpoint's purpose.
- ``--`` terminates tmux option parsing so text beginning with ``-`` cannot
  be parsed as a flag (argument-injection guard).
- Named special keys are restricted to ``ALLOWED_KEYS`` -- an explicit,
  closed set. Anything else is rejected at the API boundary (400).
- Targets are the plain session name (same as capture_pane / connect /
  delete). tmux's ``=name`` exact-match prefix is NOT valid for a
  ``send-keys`` pane target (it raises "can't find pane"), so we rely on the
  same guarantee those endpoints do: the endpoint only proceeds after an
  exact ``name in known_sessions`` membership check, and tmux resolves an
  exact session name to itself before any prefix match -- so ``-t name``
  cannot land on a neighbouring session.
- The per-session allowlist (``settings.input_allowed_sessions``) is matched
  as **glob patterns** (see ``session_matches_allowlist``), not exact
  strings -- ``"*"`` allows every session, ``"amplifier-*"`` allows a
  prefix family. A literal name with no glob metacharacters still matches
  only itself, so existing exact-name configs behave unchanged.

#   (E2BIG) from exec; 8 KiB is plenty for typed input and keeps every
#   send well inside that limit. Measured in UTF-8 encoded bytes.
# - MAX_KEYS: each named key forks one tmux subprocess, so an unbounded
#   list is a fork amplifier. 64 keys is far beyond any legitimate
#   interactive sequence.

    The endpoint only calls this after confirming ``name`` is an exact member

    This is the entire security boundary for who a remote agent may type
    into, so its matching rules are deliberate and non-negotiable:

    - Matching is **case-INSENSITIVE** (operator preference), but achieved
      deterministically: both *name* and *pattern* are explicitly
      ``.casefold()``-ed, then compared with ``fnmatch.fnmatchcase``. Do
      not "simplify" this to plain ``fnmatch.fnmatch`` for the
      case-insensitivity -- ``fnmatch.fnmatch`` gets its case-folding as a
      side effect of ``os.path.normcase``, which is a no-op on Linux and
      case-folding on macOS/Windows. That makes ``fnmatch.fnmatch``'s
      behavior *platform-dependent* (case-sensitive on Linux, insensitive
      on macOS/Windows) -- exactly the kind of environment-dependent
      security fence that must never exist. Explicit ``casefold()`` +
      ``fnmatchcase`` gives the same, deliberately case-insensitive result
      on every platform muxplex runs on. (``.casefold()`` rather than
      ``.lower()``: it's the correct Unicode-aware case-normalization;
      session names are ASCII-restricted by ``is_valid_session_name`` so
      the two coincide here, but casefold is the right habit.)
    - Empty *patterns* returns False for every *name* (fail-closed): an
      empty allowlist must deny everything, never be silently treated as
      "no restriction" / allow-all.
    - Non-string entries are skipped rather than raising, so a malformed
      settings.json (e.g. a stray int or null in the list) degrades to
      "that one entry never matches" instead of a 500 on every input call.
    - A literal pattern with no glob metacharacters (``*``, ``?``, ``[...]``)
      matches only that exact name (case-insensitively), so pre-existing
      exact-name configs keep working, just no longer case-sensitive.

    Patterns are operator-supplied from a local settings.json file (see
    ``settings.LOCAL_ONLY_KEYS`` -- never PATCHable, never federation-synced),
    not untrusted network input, so fnmatch's glob-to-regex translation is
    not a ReDoS surface here. *name* has already passed
    ``is_valid_session_name`` (charset restricted to
    ``[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_.-]{0,63}``) before this function ever runs, so
    there are no path-separator or traversal edge cases for the glob to
