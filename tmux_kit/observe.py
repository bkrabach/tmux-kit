"""tmux observation: epoch probe, session enumeration, pane capture.

Moved verbatim from ``sessions.py`` (tmux-lib extraction stage S1, plan
§7.1 -- docs/plans/2026-08-08-tmux-lib-extraction-plan.md). The in-memory
caches move WITH ``enumerate_sessions()`` because it populates them as a
side effect of its one tmux call; splitting function from cache would not
be a pure move.

In-memory cache:
    _session_list  — most-recently-enumerated list of session names.
    _snapshots     — most-recently-captured pane text, keyed by session name.
    _activity      — most-recently-enumerated last-output-activity timestamp
                     (unix epoch seconds), keyed by session name.
    _created       — most-recently-enumerated tmux `#{session_created}`
                     timestamp (unix epoch seconds), keyed by session name.
    _cwds          — most-recently-enumerated tmux `#{pane_current_path}`
                     (the active window's active pane's current working
                     directory), keyed by session name.

Note on _activity/_created: unlike _session_list/_snapshots (which are only
ever swapped together, atomically, via update_session_cache), _activity and
_created are populated directly by enumerate_sessions() as a side effect of
parsing tmux's output. They come from the exact same `tmux list-sessions`
call that produces the name list, so there's no second subprocess round trip
and no consistency dependency on the (separately captured) pane snapshots.
Each call fully replaces both dicts, so entries for sessions that have since
closed are dropped on the next poll, same as the other caches.

`_created` (tmux `#{session_created}`) is intrinsic to the tmux session
itself -- set once, by tmux, at the moment the session was actually created
-- and is therefore the one signal in this module that survives muxplex
restarting, its state.json being deleted, or a fresh install: none of those
events touch tmux's own bookkeeping. This is what lets main.py's poll cycle
distinguish "genuinely just created" from "merely first observed by this
process" when deciding whether to seed a session's bell as needing
attention (see main.py's `_server_start_time` and the "Ensure bell entries"
step of `_run_poll_cycle()`).

Why `#{window_activity}` and not `#{session_activity}`: tmux's session-level
`session_activity` only advances when a *client is attached* to the session
(verified empirically: sending real output to a headless, never-attached
session left `session_activity` frozen at its creation time indefinitely,
while `window_activity` advanced immediately). Since muxplex's whole point
is surfacing sessions producing output *unattended* -- e.g. a build running
in a session nobody has open in a browser tab right now -- `session_activity`
would silently fail to track exactly the sessions this feature most needs to
surface. `window_activity` tracks real pane output regardless of client
attachment. It resolves correctly (matching `list-windows -a` for the same
window) when queried in a `list-sessions -F` context, which implicitly
selects each session's active window -- consistent with capture_pane()
elsewhere in this module, which likewise only ever looks at a session's
active window/pane.

    effect, caches each session's last-activity epoch timestamp (see
    get_session_activity()), its tmux-assigned creation epoch (see
    get_session_created_times()), and its active pane's current working
    directory (see get_session_cwds()) -- all parsed from the same tmux
    call, so no second subprocess round trip is needed just to learn any of

# the visible screen (0 = first visible row, negative = history) -- see the
# module's own `man tmux` entry, confirmed empirically in the plan (\u00a72.1).
# There is no absolute-addressing mode. Converting an absolute row index
# (`before`, defined as `history_size + rel` -- \u00a72.3) into the `-S`/`-E`
# tmux expects therefore REQUIRES knowing the CURRENT `history_size` before
# the `capture-pane` argv can even be built -- and a single tmux invocation
# cannot feed one chained command's output into another's arguments. So
# converting a caller-supplied `before` is necessarily two tmux round trips:
#
#   1. capture_pane_metadata() -- a cheap, capture-free probe for the
#      CURRENT history_size/pane_height/history_limit, used ONLY to convert
#      `before` into a relative `-S`/`-E` pair.
#   2. capture_pane_window(), using the coordinates from (1) -- one atomic
