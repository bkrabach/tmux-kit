"""Session spawning: the general half of "create a tmux session from a
shell-command template".

Split out of ``sessions.spawn_session_command()`` at stage S2 (plan §13.2
stage 3, §15.1 -- docs/plans/2026-08-08-tmux-lib-extraction-plan.md). The
original plan left the whole spawn path app-side because it read muxplex's
settings (``sessions.py:691`` pre-move); the S2 inversion makes the
TEMPLATE CALLER-RESOLVED, which frees the general half -- the PATH
pre-flight, the ``{name}`` substitution with ``shlex.quote()``
defense-in-depth, the cgroup escape (the 44-session incident, see
``tmux/cgroup.py``), the 30s long-lived-command tolerance, and the
exists-despite-nonzero-exit TTY-attach tolerance -- to live behind the
library boundary, where a second app creating sessions needs it and must
not rediscover it.

What deliberately stays app-side (plan §4.3: configuration is injected,
never read): resolving WHICH template to run. muxplex resolves its
``session_commands`` / ``new_session_template`` settings in
``sessions.spawn_session_command()`` and passes the resolved template
string in; a second app resolves its own config its own way.

) -> tuple[bool, str | None]:
    """Run *template* (with ``{name}`` substituted) to create a tmux session
    named *name*. Returns ``(ok, error)``.

    *template* is a CALLER-RESOLVED arbitrary user shell command with a
    ``{name}`` placeholder (e.g. ``tmux new-session -d -s {name}``, or a
    user's own ``amplifier-workspace {name}``), so this stays shell-based to
    preserve that feature. Injection is closed by two layers: (1) the
    caller's name validation/allowlist guarantees the name has no shell
    metacharacters; (2) ``shlex.quote()`` here is defense-in-depth in case
    that is ever loosened -- for an allowlist-valid name it's a no-op.
    Callers at an API boundary MUST validate the name first
    (``is_valid_session_name``) -- this function does not, so it stays
    usable from a plain CLI process with no HTTP framework in scope.

    *env* is INJECTED config (plan §4.3), with the SAME omit-vs-``None``
    semantics as ``proc.run_tmux()``: passing nothing consults the
    app-installed ``proc.set_env_factory()`` factory (if any) at call time;
    passing ``env=None`` explicitly inherits this process's environment
    unchanged; passing an explicit dict uses it verbatim. muxplex always
    passes its settings-resolved ``tmux_env()`` explicitly, so this default
    is a no-op for it either way.

    Fixed 0.2.0: before this release the default was a bare ``None``
    (silently "inherit ambient, ignore any installed factory"), which
    diverged from every other function in this package (``run_tmux``,
    and everything built on it) that consults the installed factory when
    ``env`` is omitted. A consumer who called ``set_env_factory()`` once at
    startup and then called ``spawn_session(name, template)`` with no
    ``env=`` got a session created against the AMBIENT default tmux socket,
    while a subsequent ``enumerate_sessions()`` (which does consult the
    factory) looked for it on the configured socket and found nothing --
    the exact failure that motivated this fix (see CHANGELOG).

    The command may start a brand-new tmux SERVER (both the default template
    and e.g. ``amplifier-workspace`` start one if none is running yet). If we
    are running under a systemd --user unit, that server must NOT be spawned
    as a plain child of this process -- see ``lib/tmux_kit/cgroup.py``'s
    module docstring and AGENTS.md's "Two ways to destroy every live tmux
    session on this host" (mechanism #1).

    Some session commands (e.g. ``amplifier-workspace``) create the tmux
    session and then attempt to *attach* to it, which requires a TTY. When
    launched with no TTY available (a service process, or a non-interactive
    CLI invocation) the attach step fails with a non-zero exit code even
    though the session was successfully created. To handle this, when the
    command exits non-zero we check whether a tmux session with the
    requested name now exists -- if it does, we treat it as a success.

    Returns:
        (True, None) on success.
        (False, <error message>) on failure -- the caller decides how to
        surface it (HTTPException for an API, a printed FAIL line for a
        CLI).
